# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) for front-end applications

https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview

In FSD, a project consists of _layers_, _slices_ and _segments_.

## Layers

_Layers_ are vertically arranged. ❗️Code on one _layer_ can only interact with code from the _layers_ below.

### 1. `shared/`

Reusable functionality, detached from the business (e.g. UIKit, libs, API). ❗️No business logic here.

### 2. `entities/`

Elements which have a business value (e.g. BlogPost, User, Order, Product). Can be a components with slots for content/interactive elements.

Should contain the logic to describe how _entity_ looks and behaves (e.g. static UI elements, data stores, CRUD operations, reducers, selectors, mappers).

### 3. `features/`

_Entity_ can act differently depending on _features_ we apply on top of it (e.g. the User _entity_ with different _features_ can show a contact card or get a personal ad or be granted access etc...).

_Feature_ is an action on _entity_ to achieve a valuable outcome (e.g. create-blog-post, login-by-auth, edit-account, publish-video).

Can contain interactive UI elements, internal state and API calls that enable value-producing actions.

### 4. `widgets/`

Compositional _layer_ to combine lower-level units from _entities_ + _features_ into meaningful assembled blocks with content and interactive buttons wired to the api calls (e.g. PostCard, IssuesList, UserProfile).

In this _layer_ we fill slots left in the UI of _Entities_ with other _Entities_ and interactive elements from _Features_.

Usually non-business logic come here (e.g. gestures, keyboard interaction, etc). For reach widgets business logic is permitted.

❗️It might be hard to decide what goes into _Entities_ and _Features_. Do not worry. Just put all logic into _Widgets_ layer. You will feel later if it should be split into _Entities_ and _Features_.

### 5. `pages/`

Compositional layer to construct full pages or views from _entities_, _features_ and _widgets_ (e.g. route components for each page/slot). ❗️No business and minimum other logic here.

### 6. `app/`

App-wide settings, (e.g. styles, providers, router, store).

## Slices

A _layer_ can be divided into business oriented _slices_ to keep related code together (e.g. post, add-user-to-friends, news-feed...)

1. `Shared` and `App` _layers_ never have _slices_ (they do not have business logic inside).
2. ❗️*Slices* cannot use other _slices_ on the same _layer_.
3. Closely related slices can be grouped in a directory, but they still should follow rule above.
4. ❗️*Slices* (and _segments_ without _slices_) must contain the `index.ts` entry points (public API) with module re-exports. Code outside should not reference internal _slice_ file structure, but public API only.

## Segments

A _slice_ consists of _segments_ to separate code by its technical nature, common _segments_, ❗️but not necessarily are:

1. `ui/` ui-logic, components
2. `model/` business logic, store, actions, selectors
3. `lib/` utils, helpers, hooks
4. `api/` communication with external APIs, backend API methods
